# Armstrong Number Checker

This C++ program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

# How it works:
1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. **Calculation**: It separates each digit of the number, computes the cube of each digit, and sums these cubes.
3. **Comparison**: It compares the computed sum with the original number.
4. **Output**: It displays whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

# Example:
For input `153`:
- Calculation: \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 \)
- Output: `153 is Armstrong Number`

# How to Use:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter a number when prompted.
4. See the output indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number.
