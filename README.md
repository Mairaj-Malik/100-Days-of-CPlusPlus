# 100-Days-of-CPlusPlus

Welcome to my **100 Days of C++** challenge repository! ðŸŽ‰

# Overview
This repository is dedicated to my 100-day journey of solving one C++ problem each day. The goal of this challenge is to improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of C++, and create a comprehensive portfolio of coding solutions.

# Structure
Each day, a new directory is created to store the solution for that day's problem. The structure of the repository is as follows:
```
100-Days-of-CPlusPlus/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day01/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solution.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ Day02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solution.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ Day03/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solution.cpp
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

# Daily Workflow
1. **Problem Solving**: I solve a new C++ problem each day, sourced from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.
2. **Documentation**: Each solution is documented with a brief description of the problem, my approach, and any challenges faced.
3. **Commit and Push**: The solution is committed to this repository with a meaningful message, and the changes are pushed to GitHub.
4. **Sharing**: I share my progress on LinkedIn daily, including a summary of the problem and a link to the specific solution.

# Goals
- **Skill Development**: Enhance my C++ programming skills through consistent practice.
- **Portfolio Building**: Create a public portfolio of coding solutions that showcases my problem-solving abilities.
- **Networking**: Engage with the coding community by sharing my journey and receiving feedback.
